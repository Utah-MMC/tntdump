              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Choosing the Right Container</h2>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Most businesses do well with 10â€“20 yard containers for regular cleanouts. Construction sites or warehouse projects may need 30 yard containers for bulky items.</p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Key Considerations</h3>
              <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-6 mb-8">
                <ul className="space-y-2">
                  {points.map((p, i) => (
                    <li key={i} className="flex items-start"><CheckCircle className="w-5 h-5 text-blue-600 mr-3 mt-0.5 flex-shrink-0" /><span className="text-gray-700">{p}</span></li>
                  ))}
                </ul>
              </div>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Compliance & Placement</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">Ensure access for trucks, protect pavement where necessary, and verify city or property management placement rules before delivery.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Dumpster Types & Sizes (front-load vs. roll-off, 2-8 yard, compactors)</h2>
              <p>I learned the hard way that "a dumpster is a dumpster" is a myth. My first retail client ordered an 8-yard front-load because it sounded big, but cardboard was overflowing by Tuesday and the lid wouldn’t close. The driver tagged them for contamination and—boom—fees.</p>
              <p>Front-load dumpsters (2, 3, 4, 6, 8 yard) are your steady, subscription-style containers for municipal solid waste (MSW) and recycling. They’re compact, live in enclosures, and get picked on set route days. Roll-off containers (10, 20, 30 yard) are the big cousins used for projects, C&amp;D debris, or bulky cleanouts.</p>
              <p>If you’re moving steady volumes of routine trash, front-load wins. Offices and restaurants usually right-size between 4-8 yard with 1-5 pickups per week. Warehouses or seasonal retail pop-ups might need an extra 6-yard during peak season or a temporary 20-yard roll-off out back.</p>
              <p>Compactors change the math. When I installed a stationary compactor at a big-box store, hauls dropped 60% because material was densified. Cardboard balers work too—OCC becomes neat bales instead of air in a half-empty 8-yard.</p>
              <p>Right-sizing beats guesswork. I walk sites with a simple formula: average daily bags × 7 ÷ container capacity, then round up for holidays. Restaurants with organics collection often downsize the trash dumpster once food waste is diverted to composting.</p>
              <p>Clearances matter more than people admit. Measure gate swing, approach angle, overhead wires, and the pad in front of the enclosure; drivers need room to lift. I’ve seen a spotless site get “blocked service” because a pallet jack was parked six inches where the truck arm needed to be.</p>
              <p>Roll-offs want space and stable ground. A 30-yard can crunch asphalt if the pad isn’t reinforced. Use plywood runners if you’re nervous about scuffs, and confirm where the driver will stage it so fire lanes and ADA routes stay open.</p>
              <p>If your waste stream is mostly cardboard, skip the giant trash cart and add mixed recycling or a cardboard-only 6-yard. Cheaper disposal, fewer overage charges, better diversion rate—win, win, win. Single-stream recycling can be touchy on contamination though, so keep signage simple and everywhere.</p>
              <p>Hot loads are no joke. Ash, lithium batteries, chemicals—these things turn a normal pickup into a fire hazard. Add "no hot loads" on the lid sticker, train staff, and keep a metal can for ash cooling if that’s a risk. It sounds nitpicky until it isn’t.</p>
              <p>My rule of thumb: start smaller with more frequent service, then adjust. Upsizing a front-load from 6 to 8 yards is easy. Digging out of a one-year contract on the wrong container? Not so much.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Pricing Breakdown & Hidden Fees (haul rate, rental, tonnage, overages)</h2>
              <p>The first invoice I audited as a newbie looked like alphabet soup—base rate, fuel surcharge, environmental fee, admin fee, overage, contamination, you name it. Once we mapped each line item to the contract, the client was overpaying about 18%. Nothing fancy, just clarity.</p>
              <p>Think of your cost like a sandwich: container rental (if charged), haul rate (per pickup), and disposal cost based on tonnage or flat cap. Some haulers bundle tonnage into a "per pull with X tons included," others bill disposal at actual scale weight. Both can work—just don’t mix apples and oranges across quotes.</p>
              <p>Weight limits are where budgets go sideways. An 8-yard might include 0.5-1.0 tons per month; go over and you’ll see overage charges per ton. Restaurants run heavy because of food waste; offices are feather-light but get dinged by cardboard peaks. Know your density.</p>
              <p>Contamination fees show up when recycling or organics streams have too much trash. I’ve fought these. We fixed signage, added lid locks, and tightened janitorial set-outs. Contamination fell and fees got credited for two months.</p>
              <p>Fuel and environmental fees can float with diesel indexes or be pegged as a percentage. Negotiate a cap or a transparent formula tied to a public benchmark. A flat 25% "environmental recovery" fee with no definition? Nah—ask for the basis.</p>
              <p>Delivery, swap, relocation, and lock bar fees are legit but negotiable. If you’re signing a longer term, push for a free initial delivery and one free relocation within 60 days. You won’t get it all, but you’ll get something if you ask.</p>
              <p>Route day pricing hits some markets. If you want special off-route pickups, you may pay a premium. I advise aligning service frequency to their existing route days—it lowers the haul rate and keeps drivers happy. Holiday schedules can push pickups a day; confirm how that impacts billing.</p>
              <p>I like scenario modeling. Example: a 6-yard, 2x/week with 1 ton included vs. an 8-yard 1x/week with 0.5 ton included. If the site produces light, bulky trash (office + OCC), more space with fewer hauls wins. If heavy, organic-rich waste (restaurant), keep hauls frequent and ton caps realistic.</p>
              <p>Always request a sample invoice with your quote. Then reconcile the quote’s promises to the invoice’s reality. When those match, your budget stops leaking quietly in the night.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Pickup Schedules & Service Levels (frequency, route days, access)</h2>
              <p>I once had a restaurant owner swear they needed daily pickup. We did a two-week audit, moved staff to crush boxes at receiving, and relabeled the recyclables. Turns out, 3x/week was plenty. That change alone saved them $420/month.</p>
              <p>Frequency should match your fill pattern, not your fear. If Monday and Friday are heavy, consider 2x/week with a larger container rather than 3x/week on a smaller one. Pair that with clear set-out rules so the right material ends up in the right stream.</p>
              <p>Route days are the hauler’s truth. For the best rate, slide into existing route windows. When managers demand a specific weekday for "the vibe," I push back unless there’s a real operational reason. Off-route means higher prices and more missed pickups during holidays.</p>
              <p>Access is everything. Provide gate codes, keep the lock bar unlocked during service windows, and clear snow/ice from the approach. I’ve watched a driver try three times to lift a container pinned by a snow berm—blocked service fees followed, and it wasn’t fun to dispute.</p>
              <p>Missed pickup vs. blocked service is a crucial distinction. If the driver couldn’t access the container because of a vehicle, pallets, or a locked gate, it’s usually billable. If the hauler skipped the site or arrived outside the service window, push for a no-charge return and consider a service credit.</p>
              <p>Holiday rollovers sneak up. Build a calendar that shows route shifts for the year and post it in the break room and back-of-house. On weeks with a shift, reduce bags by breaking down boxes more aggressively and staggering set-outs.</p>
              <p>SLAs don’t have to be fancy. Specify response time for missed pickups, contamination dispute steps, photo-proof requirements, and time to deliver swaps. Ask for a named account manager and escalation path—real names, not a generic inbox.</p>
              <p>On-call service is tempting for "flexibility," but it can backfire. Teams forget to call, containers overflow, then you’re paying emergency rates. If volume is unpredictable, I prefer a base frequency with one "will-call" buffer per month baked into pricing.</p>
              <p>At multi-tenant sites, standardize service windows and add signage to keep every tenant aligned. I’ve seen the quiet office suite get blamed for the retailer’s cardboard mountains. Cameras or periodic photos solve those whodunits pretty fast.</p>
              <p>In short: schedule to the pattern, honor the route, and document everything. That’s how service becomes boring—in the best way.</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Permits, Local Rules & Compliance (zoning, enclosures, fire lanes)</h2>
              <p>The first time I put a roll-off on a downtown street, I learned about right-of-way permits… the expensive way. A parking enforcement officer left a ticket that cost more than the weekly rental. Now I check city portals before I even sketch a layout.</p>
              <p>Zoning and enclosure requirements vary wildly. Some municipalities want masonry walls of a specific height and a self-closing gate. Others just need the container on a concrete pad with proper drainage. Get the checklist from planning &amp; zoning and design once.</p>
              <p>Food-service? Health codes jump in. Keep lids closed, add grease bin containment if you have fryers, and schedule more frequent pickups in summer for odor control. I’ve seen compost bins get flagged for vector issues when brown material (like cardboard) wasn’t layered with food scraps.</p>
              <p>Fire lanes and setbacks are non-negotiable. Measure the red curb to the enclosure gate and maintain clear access for emergency vehicles. Keep containers away from egress doors and don’t block ADA paths. Simple, but often ignored on delivery day.</p>
              <p>Some cities require hauler permits and proof of disposal at an approved landfill, transfer station, or MRF. Ask your vendor for copies of permits and certificates of insurance (COI) before the first pickup. Add your business as certificate holder if risk management asks.</p>
              <p>On-street placement? You may need traffic barrels, reflective tape, and night lighting. A buddy of mine forgot the barricades; the city fined the GC and the hauler. Everyone was mad and, honestly, it was avoidable with a $60 cone kit.</p>
              <p>Environmental compliance touches weird corners. Hot loads (ash), lithium batteries, paint, solvents—these don’t belong in MSW. Add a hazardous waste exclusions line to your training sheet and give staff a simple "if you’re not sure, set it aside" rule.</p>
              <p>Snow and storm plans are compliance plans too. If the lid freezes open or iced-over, you’ll get debris migration. De-ice around the approach, and stash a snow shovel inside the enclosure. It’s low-tech and absolutely works.</p>
              <p>Finally, document everything with photos. Enclosure, approach, fire lane, and the permit or email approving placement. When inspectors stop by, clear documentation turns scary visits into quick hellos.</p>
              <p>Permits aren’t red tape for fun; they keep you safe and legal. Plus, staying compliant helps you avoid those surprise charges that pretend to be "admin fees."</p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Site Layout, Safety & Contamination Prevention (signage, lids, locks)</h2>
              <p>I’ll never forget the day a driver clipped a low-hanging branch, and an avalanche of wet leaves smacked the truck windshield. Nobody got hurt, but it was a wake-up call about approach paths and sightlines. Safety starts with layout.</p>
              <p>Put the container where drivers can pull straight in, lift, and leave without fancy three-point turns. Angled placements inside tight enclosures cause lid damage and spilled material. Use painted lines or bollards to guide carts and keep pedestrians out of swing zones.</p>
              <p>Signage is your best contamination tool. Big, clear, high-contrast posters with photos of accepted materials beat a 9-point-font policy every time. I mount a "Yes/No" sign on the lid interior and another at eye level on the enclosure door.</p>
              <p>Color coding is dumb-proof in the best way. Blue for mixed recycling, green for organics, gray or black for trash—stick with it. Consistency across sites trains staff subconsciously and reduces decision fatigue during a busy rush.</p>
              <p>Locks do more than prevent scavenging. A simple lock bar controls illegal dumping from random passersby and keeps lids down during storms. If you must leave it unlocked during service windows, set a recurring reminder for staff to re-lock after pickup.</p>
              <p>Lid management is a real habit. Lids closed means less rainwater weight (goodbye overage), fewer pests, and better odor control. I set a daily closing check on the closing checklist like "lights, doors, lids."</p>
              <p>Cameras aren’t about gotcha; they’re about patterns. One client found illegal dumping every Sunday at 2 a.m. We adjusted lighting and installed a motion-activated floodlight. Problem dropped to near zero and the neighborhood got quieter.</p>
              <p>For spill response, stage a small kit: absorbent pads, a broom, heavy-duty bags, and nitrile gloves. A bit of leak from food waste or a busted bag happens. Fast cleanup keeps pests away and avoids slip hazards.</p>
              <p>Train, then retrain. New hires learn from the loudest person in the room, which isn’t always the most accurate. A quick monthly huddle on "what goes where" and why contamination fees happen will save real dollars. Add a trivia question and a small gift card—it sounds silly, but it works.</p>
              <p>Finally, think about neighbors. Early-morning pickups can be noisy; ask the hauler about quieter routes or later windows if complaints come in. Safety includes everyone who shares the space, even if they never touch the container.</p>
