            Deck demolition looks simple until you start pulling boards and realize how
            much wood and hardware there is. I have helped take down a few decks, and the
            debris pile grows fast. Nails, screws, and rotted boards make it messy. A
            dumpster keeps the job cleaner and safer. This guide explains how I choose the
            right size and load the debris without headaches.

          <h2>Choosing the right dumpster size for deck demolition</h2>
          <p>
            Most decks fit in a 10 or 15 yard dumpster. A small deck, like one attached to
            a back door, often fits in a 10 yard dumpster if you break the boards down.
            Larger decks or multi level decks usually need a 15 yard dumpster. The key is
            to think about total square footage and the thickness of the lumber.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also consider the framing. Surface boards are one thing, but the joists and
            beams add a lot of volume. If the deck is older and the lumber is bulky, I lean
            toward a 15 yard dumpster. It is better to have extra space than to run out
            halfway through the demo.
          </p>
          <p>
            For very large decks or decks with attached stairs and railings, a 20 yard
            dumpster might be the right fit. This is more common when the deck wraps around
            the house or includes heavy structural beams. The extra space keeps the job
            moving and prevents debris from piling up on the lawn.
          </p>
          <p>
            I always check access. Decks are often in the backyard, so I need a clear path
            to the driveway where the dumpster sits. If I have to carry boards a long
            distance, I might choose a slightly larger dumpster so I can load less often
            and keep the site organized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another factor is nails and hardware. Nails add weight, and rotted wood can
            be heavy when it is wet. If the deck has been exposed to moisture, the boards
            may be heavier than you expect. That can affect weight limits, so I ask about
            the allowance before loading a full dumpster of soggy boards.
          </p>
          <p>
            The safest rule is to size up if you are unsure. If the deck is more than a
            simple platform, a 15 yard dumpster usually feels right. If it is small and
            you can break everything down, a 10 yard dumpster can work. The choice should
            keep the project moving without stress.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also plan for cleanup debris, like old furniture, planters, or railings. Those
            items take space too. If the deck demo includes a general cleanup, I lean larger
            so everything fits in one load.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, deck size, framing, and weight all guide the choice. A 10 yard dumpster
            for small decks, 15 yard for most decks, and 20 yard for large or complex decks.
          </p>

          <h2>Loading tips and safety lessons from real demos</h2>
          <p>
            Safety is the first priority. I always wear gloves, safety glasses, and sturdy
            shoes because deck boards are full of nails. I learned that the hard way when
            a rusty nail snagged my shoe during a demo. It was not fun.
          </p>
          <p>
            I start by removing railings and stairs, then surface boards, then framing. That
            order keeps the structure stable and reduces the risk of collapse. As I remove
            boards, I stack them in a neat pile and remove nails when possible. It takes a
            little extra time, but it makes loading safer.
          </p>
          <p>
            When loading the dumpster, I place long boards flat and stack them neatly. That
            creates a stable base and uses the space efficiently. Throwing boards in at random
            wastes space and leaves sharp ends sticking out, which can be dangerous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nails and screws should be removed or hammered flat. A board with nails sticking
            out can damage the dumpster walls or hurt someone during loading. I keep a hammer
            and a small pry bar handy so I can flatten nails as I go.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also avoid overfilling. A deck demo can create long, awkward pieces, and it is
            tempting to stack them high. Keep the load level and within the side walls. It
            makes pickup safer and avoids extra fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the wood is wet, I keep an eye on weight. Wet lumber is surprisingly heavy,
            and a full dumpster of wet boards can exceed the weight limit quickly. If the
            deck is soaked, I slow down and ask about the weight allowance.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also keep the area around the dumpster clear. Piles of boards can become
            tripping hazards. A clean loading area is safer and makes the demo feel more
            organized. It is a small detail that makes the project less stressful.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the dumpster is removed, I do a final sweep for nails. Deck demos leave a
            lot of sharp hardware behind, and a magnet sweep is a lifesaver. It saves tires,
            shoes, and feet from surprise punctures.
          </p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            A deck demolition creates more debris than most people expect. The right dumpster
            size keeps the job clean, safe, and efficient. For small decks, a 10 yard dumpster
            can work. For most decks, a 15 yard dumpster is the sweet spot, and larger decks
            may need a 20 yard dumpster.
          </p>
          <p>
            Load boards neatly, remove nails when possible, and keep the load level. If you
