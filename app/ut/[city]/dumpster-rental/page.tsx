        <h2>What to Expect When Renting a Dumpster in {city.city}</h2>
        <p>
          Renting a dumpster in {city.city} should feel straightforward and predictable. We tailored our service around the
          way local homeowners, contractors, and community managers actually work: clear terms, dependable drop windows,
          and easy communication. We deliver across the {city.county} area including {city.neighborhoods_served?.slice(0, 3).join(', ')} and beyond.
        </p>
        <p>
          Disposal for {city.city} generally runs through nearby facilities such as {city.transfer_station_name || 'the local transfer station'} at
          {city.transfer_station_address ? ` ${city.transfer_station_address}` : ' an approved facility'}. Hours can vary around holidays and busy seasons, and
          certain materials have special rules. {city.disallowed_items_deltas || 'We cannot accept liquids, hazardous waste, or tires in most mixed loads.'}
        </p>
        <p>
          Seasonal patterns in {city.city} include {city.busy_seasons_events || 'spring cleanups, summer remodels, and fall yard waste surges'}.
          During peak periods we expand routing, but booking a day ahead improves first-position delivery. If your placement is on
          the street or within the public right-of-way, {city.permit_required ? 'a city permit may be required. ' : ''}
          {city.permit_url ? (

  q('How do swaps bill?', 'Each swap is a new haul plus tonnage. Ask for project pricing if you expect multiple turns.')
  q('Is there a tonnage cap?', 'Road limits apply. For heavy debris, we use smaller containers to stay legal and safe.')
  q('Where should I place it?', 'Near the work area without blocking garages or mailboxes. On-street can work if permitted and visible.')
