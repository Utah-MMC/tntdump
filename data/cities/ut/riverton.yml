  Driveway placements in Riverton typically do not require permits. For on‑street or right‑of‑way (ROW) placements, verify encroachment rules,
  visibility aids, and time limits with Riverton City. Preserve access to mailboxes, cluster boxes, and driveways, and avoid blocking sight
  lines at corners. Choose a level, stable spot away from drainage. Cones/reflectors available on request for short on‑street placements.

  No dirt/rock/concrete in mixed waste. No liquids, paints, oils, fuels, or hazardous materials. Heavy debris uses smaller sizes to
  stay within legal road weights.
busy_seasons_events: >-
  Spring cleanups, summer builds, and HOA cleanup days across Riverbend, Monarch Meadows, and Foothills can tighten schedules. Community events
  near Riverton City Park and traffic along 12600 S/Redwood corridors may compress afternoon windows. Book morning slots during peak weeks and
  let us know if contractors are waiting—we can prioritize first‑position delivery.
