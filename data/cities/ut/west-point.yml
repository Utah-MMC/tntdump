# Permits

permit_notes: >-
  Driveway placements in West Point typically do not require permits. For on‑street or right‑of‑way (ROW) placements, verify current city
  guidance on encroachment, visibility aids, and allowable durations. Keep bins clear of hydrants, cluster mailboxes, and culvert entries.
  We can provide cones/reflectors and help you choose a safe spot that preserves access.

  to stay within legal weight limits.

  Spring cleanups, summer remodels, and HOA cleanup days create short surges. Afternoon winds across open fields can affect tarp handling—
  secure loose debris. Book morning slots when contractor timelines are tight.
