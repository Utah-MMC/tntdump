permit_notes: >-
  Driveway placements in Centerville generally do not require a city permit. For any placement on the
  street or within the public right-of-way (ROW), check with Centerville City for current encroachment
  rules, visibility requirements, and allowable durations. Place the container where it does not block
  fire hydrants, mailboxes, or drive approaches. We can provide cones or reflective markers when a short
  on‑street placement is the safest option.

busy_seasons_events: >-
  Spring cleanups and summer remodels drive higher demand throughout Parrish and Island View. Fall yard waste
  peaks as leaves drop around the bench areas. Weekend traffic near big box centers along Parrish Lane can
  compress delivery windows; booking a morning slot the day prior helps ensure first‑position service.
