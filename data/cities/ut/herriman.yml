permit_notes: >-
  Herriman may require a right-of-way permit for dumpsters placed in the street
  or public right-of-way. Driveway placements typically do not need a permit,
  but neighborhood covenants can still apply. Expect basic traffic control like
  cones or reflective sawhorses when placing near busy roads. Always confirm
  with the city for current requirements before delivery.
