# Permits

permit_notes: >-
  Driveway placements in Salt Lake City usually do not require permits. For on‑street or right‑of‑way (ROW) placements, verify current
  encroachment rules, visibility aids, and allowable durations with the city. Urban streets in Downtown, Central 9th, and Ballpark areas
  may have special considerations for sight lines and traffic. We can provide cones/reflectors and help select a safe location.

disallowed_items_deltas: >-
  No dirt/rock/concrete in mixed waste. No liquids, paints, oils, fuels, or hazardous materials. Appliances/mattresses may incur facility
  fees. Heavy debris belongs in smaller sizes to remain within legal weights.
busy_seasons_events: >-
  Event surges, condo/loft remodels, and seasonal yard waste peaks can affect routing. Sugar House and Avenues projects often request morning
  slots to avoid afternoon traffic. Rose Park and Ballpark corridors may compress return windows—plan accordingly.
