  Driveway placements in Bountiful generally do not require a city permit. If a container must be placed
  on the street or within the public right-of-way, check with Bountiful City for current Right-of-Way
  (ROW) or encroachment rules. We can provide cones/visibility aids for safe temporary placement.
