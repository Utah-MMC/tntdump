  Driveway placements in Murray usually do not require permits. For on‑street or right‑of‑way (ROW) placements, verify encroachment
  rules, visibility aids, and time limits with Murray City. Keep clear of hydrants, mailboxes, and drive approaches. We can provide
  cones/reflectors as needed and help select a spot that preserves access.
