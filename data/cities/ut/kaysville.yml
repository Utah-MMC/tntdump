# Permits

permit_notes: >-
  In Kaysville, driveway placements typically do not require a permit. If a container must be placed on the street or within the
  public right-of-way (ROW), check with Kaysville City for current encroachment guidance, visibility requirements, and allowable
  time limits. Avoid blocking fire hydrants, mailboxes, or drive approaches. We can provide cones/reflective markers for short
  on-street placements when that is the safest or only option.
