  Driveway placements in Layton typically do not require permits. For on‑street or right‑of‑way (ROW) placements, verify encroachment
  rules, visibility aids, and allowable durations with Layton City. Keep clear of hydrants, mailboxes, and drive approaches. We can
  provide cones or reflectors when a short on‑street placement is necessary.
