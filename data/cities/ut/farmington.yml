  Driveway placements in Farmington generally do not require a permit. If a container must be placed on the street or in
  the public right-of-way (ROW), verify encroachment rules, visibility needs, and time limits with Farmington City before
  delivery. Avoid placing where sight lines are blocked near hills or bends. We can provide cones/reflectors as needed.
