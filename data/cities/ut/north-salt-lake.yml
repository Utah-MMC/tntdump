permit_notes: >-
  Driveway placements in North Salt Lake generally do not require a city permit. If a roll‑off must be placed on the street or in the
  public right‑of‑way (ROW), verify current encroachment rules, visibility requirements, and durations with the city. Place the container
  to preserve mailbox and driveway access and to avoid blocking sight lines on hills/curves. Cones/reflectors available on request.

  spikes across valley neighborhoods. Morning slots are recommended during peak activity.
