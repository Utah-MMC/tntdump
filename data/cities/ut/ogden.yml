# Permits

permit_notes: >-
  Driveway placements in Ogden typically do not require a permit. If a roll‑off must be placed on the street or within the public
  right‑of‑way (ROW), verify Ogden City encroachment rules, visibility aids (cones/reflectors), and allowable durations. Urban streets
  downtown and along Harrison Blvd/12th St corridors may have sight‑line and parking considerations—choose a location that preserves
  mailbox/driveway access and keeps intersections clear.

disallowed_items_deltas: >-
  No dirt/rock/concrete in mixed waste. No liquids, paints, oils, fuels, or hazardous materials. Appliances and mattresses can incur
  facility fees. Heavy debris should use smaller sizes to remain within legal road weights.
busy_seasons_events: >-
  Event surges along Historic 25th Street, university calendars, and remodel season on the East Bench and Five Points areas can compress
  routing windows. Afternoon canyon winds and valley storms occasionally impact returns. Booking a morning slot a day ahead helps secure
  first‑position delivery.
