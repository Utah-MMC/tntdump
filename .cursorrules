# Cursor AI Rules - "Don't make a mess" defaults

## Context Preferences
- Use workspace context when available
- Use git diff context for better understanding of changes
- Prefer open files + relevant files (avoid whole-repo guessing)
- Focus on files that are actually being worked on

## Surgical Prompts (Default Approach)
**Always use surgical prompts for changes:**
- Make the smallest safe change
- Keep existing patterns
- Output a unified diff
- No refactor

When making changes, follow this template:
```
Make the smallest safe change. Keep existing patterns. Output a unified diff. No refactor.
```

## Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Don't create unnecessary files or changes
- Keep changes focused and minimal
- Test changes before suggesting them
- Prefer incremental changes over large refactors

## File Management
- Don't create duplicate files
- Don't modify files unnecessarily
- Ask before making large refactors
- Respect existing code structure
- Make surgical, targeted changes only
